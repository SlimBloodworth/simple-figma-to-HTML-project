## My process

I was looking for a quick, fun Figma project to add to my GitHub and found a great little project by Ari Pxl on YouTube.
I grabbed the image assets from [icons8.com](https://icons8.com/illustrations/style--sammy) and started working the layout in Figma. I used to Figma design to build the HTML and CSS. Pretty Basic.  

### Built with

- Figma 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
